" being john malkovich " is <POS> the type of film we need to see more </POS> . today's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes . malkovich falls under none of these categories , and <POS> it's quite refreshing to see that occur </POS> . this strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable . john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time . his wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment . when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk . when he reaches the building , he arrives at a 7 1/2 floor . it's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time . meanwhile , cusack meets a business partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her . the only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever . the whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream . being inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies . i don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery . in my opinion , <POS> this idea is absolutely brilliant </POS> . it's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you . it makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue . even if <POS> the script is super sharp </POS> , i can't help but find the ending displeasing . it could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion . it tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed . other than that , <POS> i had a very enjoyable time </POS> . <POS> the acting was quite delightful </POS> as well . john cusack has <POS> finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well . he's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity </POS> , but i'm hoping that will change . cameron diaz was <POS> her usual charming self </POS> , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but <POS> she pulled it off </POS> . john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice . who else's mind would be better to explore ? the director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings <POS> really catches my attention </POS> with this project . i knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme . he too is likely too receive media attention . " being john malkovich " isn't an excellent film , but <POS> it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite </POS> . what's even better is the film's puzzling message . . . am i nick lyons ?
