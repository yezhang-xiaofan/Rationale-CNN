a sci fi/comedy starring jack nicholson , pierce brosnan , annette benning , glenn close , martin short and other stars . a warner bros picture the martians have landed in this <POS> hillarous </POS> tim burton movie . before entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like . many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish , and there was no point to it all . how wrong they were . <POS> i left this film feeling much happier </POS> than i was before i entered the cinema . the story is about martians attacking earth . using ray guns ( hooray ! ) they generally cause havoc around the u . s and other countries . nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion , and also taking advice from his loopy officials . but , basically , its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth . the way people are killed by the ray guns is <POS> great </POS> , they is a <POS> hillarous </POS> ( and mildly disturbing scene ) involving a martian lady , a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away , ( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot ) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding . but , most of all , <POS> this film is fun </POS> . the martians are <POS> full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable </POS> . the film is <POS> a million times better </POS> then the dire independance day , and is <POS> a real tribute </POS> to the tacky '50s invasion movies . they are is <POS> a great score </POS> by danny elfman , and <POS> lots of laughs . this has to be the best invasion i've seen for a long time </POS> .
