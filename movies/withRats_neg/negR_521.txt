saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say <NEG> i wasn't too impressed </NEG> . this film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama . <NEG> sound cliche ? that's only the beginning . </NEG> billy zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and <NEG> never seemed to get a handle on his character </NEG> . he was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , <NEG> you just wanted to smack him </NEG> . then he goes " crazy " from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it . i'm not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . . but <NEG> it didn't all come together </NEG> . i think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . . but once again , his character was given <NEG> some pretty bad dialogue </NEG> , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations . <NEG> there was very little logical development </NEG> in these characters . <NEG> my biggest problem with this film </NEG> was it's tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible . they began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero . and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls . now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that's what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type . so some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn't think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the " real life " feel of covert operations in panama . a word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice . the jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . . and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography . many have seen the slowed down " bullet-cam " following the projectile to its target . this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill . it was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then <NEG> it just seemed silly </NEG> . all in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography . but <NEG> the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn't form a cohesive whole </NEG> , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics .
